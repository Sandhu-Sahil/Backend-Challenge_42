## Description of design and technologies used
In this web application I have created and added all the technologies mentioned in Inkredu Challenge #42. It properly tracks the employment history of a person.<br>An employee can create an account with proper authentication and session
management. An employee can join a company and leave a company. On employ dashboard there is employment history with duration of stay in company. And employment dashboard is private only visible to user. These all specifications are successfully added to this web application.<br>In company view it shows list of all companies and any employ can create or join a specific company. Company dashboard is public and shows both past and present history of employs in that company. These all specifications have been also added to this web application.
